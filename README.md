# AI-Chatbot Web Application

A full-stack web application that replicates the core functionality and user experience of modern AI chatbots like ChatGPT. This was a collaborative university group project.

##  Technologies Used

*   **Front-end:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
*   **Back-end:** Python (Flask/Django)
*   **API Integration:** OpenAI GPT API
*   **NLP:** Prompt engineering, response handling

##  My Role & Contribution

As a key contributor to this group project, my primary responsibilities encompassed the full-stack development of the application:

*   **Full-Stack Development:** Architected and implemented the connection between the front-end user interface and the back-end server.
*   **Front-End Design & Implementation:** Engineered the complete chat interface using HTML and CSS to create a responsive and user-friendly website.
*   **Back-End API Integration:** Built the Python-based back-end logic to connect the web client to the **OpenAI API**, managing all request/response cycles.
*   **Core Functionality:** Developed the logic for processing user inputs, constructing effective prompts, and handling the AI-generated responses to ensure a seamless conversation flow.
